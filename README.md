# EnsembleLab

Google Colaboratory-based notebooks to study conformational ensembles of proteins.

### IDRLab

MD simulations of IDPs and IDRs with the CALVADOS2 coarse-grained model, including calculation of sequence features and structural parameters.

Run the notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/KULL-Centre/EnsembleLab/blob/main/IDRLab.ipynb).
